```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
rm(list = ls())
```

## Question 1

Use the sample() function and generate a random sample from 1 to 6 with size 1000 and with replacement.


```{r}

sample(1:6, size=1000, replace=TRUE)

```

## Question 2

Use the inverse transform method to simulate a random sample from the distribution with density fX (x) = 5x4, 0 < x < 1. Sample size is 1000. Use histogram and density plot to check your algorithm.


```{r}
n <- 1000
u <- runif(n)
x <- u^(1/5)
hist(x, prob=T)
y <- seq(0,1, 0.01)
lines(y,3*y^2)
```


## Question 3


Use the inverse transform method to simulate a random sample from Bernoulli(p=0.7). Sample size is 1000. Use mean and variance to check your algorithm.


```{r}
# Example 3.4
n <- 1000
p <- 0.7
u <- runif(n)
x <- as.integer(u > 0.3)

mean(x)
p
var(x)
p*(1-p)

```
