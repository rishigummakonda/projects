This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)

# read in data, allow string conversion to factors
train<-read.csv("http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/course/2016/datascience/TitanicTrain.csv", as.is = FALSE)
test<-read.csv("http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/course/2016/datascience/TitanicTest.csv", as.is = FALSE)

# simply cleanse age and fare
train$age <- round(train$age,0)
train$fare <- round(train$fare,0)
test$age <- round(test$age,0)
test$fare <- round(test$fare,0)

train$survived <- as.factor(train$survived) # to force classification instead of regression
test$survived <- as.factor(test$survived)
```

```{r}
set.seed(44)
#build the decision tree
tree <- rpart(survived ~ pclass + fare + sex + age + embarked, data = train, method = "class")

# build decision forest
forest <- randomForest(survived ~ pclass + fare + sex + age + embarked,
                          data = train, importance = TRUE, ntree = 1000, na.action=na.roughfix)
# plots regression
# varImpPlot(my_forest)


#evaluate tree and forest on training data
tree.train <- predict(tree, newdata=train, type="class")
forest.train <- predict(forest, newdata=train)

table.traintree <- table(tree.train, train$survived)
table.trainforest <- table(forest.train, train$survived)

#calculate accuracies
accuracy.traintree = sum(diag(table.traintree))/sum(table.traintree)
