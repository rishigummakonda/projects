This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

The goal for this lab is to become more comfortable with the typical R coding tasks for data science modeling.

Put your name at the top as the author of this R notebook.

Start by reading the mushroom data set from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/agaricus-lepiota.data and storing it in a data frame.
```{r}
data <- read.csv("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/agaricus-lepiota.data", header=FALSE, colClasses = "factor")
head(data)
str(data)
lapply(data, unique)
data$V17<-NULL

```

Sample half of the data for training, and half for testing

```{r}
m<-dim(data)[1]
val<- sample(1:m, size = m/2, replace = FALSE, prob = rep(1/m,m))
training<- data[-val,]
test<-data[val,]
head(training)
head(test)


```

Build a decision tree to predict edible mushrooms
```{r}

library(rpart)
model <- rpart(V1~., data=training, method="class")
plot(model)
text(model, use.n=TRUE)

```

Calculate and print accuracy on the test data
```{r}
pred <- predict(model, data=test, type="class")
con <- table(pred, test$V1)
print(con)
acc <- sum(diag(con))/sum(con) #accuracy
acc


```

Calculate and print precision and recall on the test data
```{r}
prec <- (con[1,1]) / (con[1,1] + con[1,2]) # precision
rec <- (con[1,1]) / (con[1,1] + con[2,1]) # recall
prec
rec

```

Do the same for another predictive method.  Your choice which method (presumably one that we have covered already).
```{r}
library("kknn")
kknnmodel <- train.kknn(V1 ~., training, kmax = 50)
summary(kknnmodel)
kpred <- predict(kknnmodel, test)

kcon <- table(kpred, test$V1)
print(kcon)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
