CSE 160 Intro to Data Science
Example of real-world clustering in class 

This notebook uses data downloaded from the College Scorecard: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ 

```{r}
college <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Treasury-Elements (2).csv")
dim(college) # just to see how much data we have 
head(college) # what does it look like?  ***Also examine in RStudio...
```


```{r}
college <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Treasury-Elements (2).csv", na.strings=c("PrivacySuppressed", "NULL"))
# the original data had multiple types of invalid entries that we need to convert to NAs
```


```{r}
college$COUNT_ED <- NULL # this column was all NA
c1 <- na.omit(college) # eliminates all rows containing NAs
c2 <- c1[1:50,] # just to look at a small subsets
d <- dist(c2[,5:88]) #calculate the distance between all points in c2, based only on columns 5-88
```


```{r}
clusters <- hclust(d, method="ward.D") # perform hierarchical clustering
plot(clusters, labels=c2$INSTNM) # show the dendrogram
```

```{r}
groups <- cutree(clusters, k=4) # cut the dendrogram at 4 clusters and record which items belong in which cluster
# Below is a function to print the contents of each cluster (using just a few attributes)
print_clusters <- function(labels) {
  for (i in 1:max(labels)) {
    print (paste("cluster", i))
    print(c2[labels==i, c("INSTNM", "MEDIAN_HH_INC", "PCT_BORN_US")])
  }
}
print_clusters(groups) # shows the contents of each cluster
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
